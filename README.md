## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Powered Hazard Detection**: Analyze dashcam footage to automatically detect road hazards
- **Real-time Warnings**: Receive alerts about nearby hazards to improve road safety
- **Blockchain Integration**: All hazard data is verified and stored on Polygon blockchain
- **Decentralized Storage**: Footage evidence stored permanently on Filecoin
- **Community Incentives**: Earn points for contributing valuable road safety data
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in English, Bahasa Indonesia, Thai, and Vietnamese
- **Location-based Services**: Customizable location settings for regional relevance

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Express.js, WebSockets for real-time updates
- **Maps**: Leaflet with OpenStreetMap integration
- **Blockchain**: Polygon (Ethereum Layer-2)
- **Storage**: Filecoin/IPFS via Web3.Storage
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o Vision for image/video analysis(Upgradeable and customisable)
